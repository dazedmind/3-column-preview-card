## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use ```flex``` more and as well as adjust the viewports in different devices. This project helps me to become more knowledgeable in front-end developing. Finishing this project made me confident with my skills and at the same time teaches me what I know and 'currently' don't know. 


### Continued development

This project is useful for future developments and helps me get ready into doing front-end development.

### Useful resources

- [This](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-directionhttps://www.example.com) - helped me understand more about flexbox and other properties.
